# ui (interview-Q)

## Features (html-css-javascript implementation)
This is just a plain clone of a website user interface. It is based on the `page_guide.jpg` file in this repo above!
The Shopping cart collects all the items collected in the cart after which you can:
* Make the cart viscible depending on whether or not it has items
* Change the quantity of each individual item
* Delete an item in the cart
* Undo a deletion within 8 seconds on deleting (It incorporates a count down timer for this)
* The footer area of the cart acts as the checkout area where your total is then displayed.

## Clone/ Download the project

To review the code you can either:
 * Follow along the commits in order to see the step by step development process.
 * Clone or download the zipped file.
 * Open the html file in a browser also in a code editor (IDE) `atom, VSC, notepad... etc`.
 * Edit the code as desired and refresh your browser to note changes.

## Requirement
- Code editor (IDE)
- Browser 

## Issues pending
- Not yet implemeted mobile responsiveness.
... + Bootstrap grid is the easiet way to go about this (for me), unlike how I have manually designed the `items on sale` in this project, using bootstrap collumns or `flexbox` is more automated for you. 
- There is no Persistence to the data collected in the cart.
