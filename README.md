# ui (interview-Q)

## Features (html-css-javascript implementation)
This is just a plain clone of a website user interface. It is based on the `page_guide.jpg` file in this repo above!

## Clone/ Download the project

To review the code you can either:
... *Follow along the commits in order to see the step by step development process.
... *Clone or download the zipped file.
... *Open the html file in a browser also in a code editor (IDE) `atom, VSC, notepad... etc`.
... *Edit the code as desired and refresh your browser to note changes.

## Requirement
- Code editor (IDE)
- Browser 

## Issues pending
- Not yet implemeted mobile responsiveness.
... + Bootstrap grid is the easiet way to go about this (for me), unlike how I have manually designed the `items on sale` in this project, using bootstrap collumns or `flexbox` is more automated for you.
